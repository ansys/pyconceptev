# Contributing

We welcome any code contributions and hope that this
guide facilitate an understanding of the PyConceptEV code.
It is important to note that while PyConceptEV
is maintained by Ansys and any submissions are reviewed
thoroughly before merging, we still seek to foster a community that can
support user questions and develop new features to make this library
useful to all. As such, we welcome and encourage any
questions or submissions to this repository.
